        <h4>About Kubwa</h4>
        <p>
          Kubwa is a residential district in Bwari, one of the local government areas in the Federal Capital Territory
          in Nigeria. It is one of the major suburbs within the metropolitan area of Abuja.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Kubwa Community has been in existence since 1990 and is considered to be the largest community in West
          Africa. The distance from Wuse Market to Kubwa is approximately 26 Kilometres. The Gbagi people were the
          original residents, but Kubwa community became an entirely new and heterogeneous community as a result of
          government policy on the relocation of the Gwagi people, having the three major ethnic groups Hausa, Yorubas,
          Igbos and other ethnic minorities as the main inhabitants of the community; they are mainly civil servants,
          businessmen and women, commercial motorcycle riders, artisans and entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <h4>Sustainable Actions of Kubwa Community</h4>
        <p>
          Generally, the Kubwa community has grown and developed sustainably; however, it has been observed to be slow
          compared to other fast-growing cities in the world.[6] Residents attribute that their new diversity of
          ethnicity and professions coupled to their new infrastructure of roads, markets, and supermarkets has created
          a durable base for their new community as well (remarkably) as doing so at a relatively affordable cost.
          Specific drivers of financial sustainability are attributed to the various types of businesses ranging from
          operating supermarkets, shops, general markets (such as Kubwa Market, site 2-phase 1 Market, etc.) engaged by
          community members. Other drivers include the fact that above 60 percent of the residents are civil servants
          who work with the federal and capital territory government organizations/institutions. The remaining are
          entrepreneurs, private security agents, low-cost housing builders, truck pushers, commercial motorcycle riders
          and real estate practitioners. Also, the establishment of cooperative societies and huge investments by
          community members have had a huge influence on Kubwa financial sustainability. The community-friendly
          investment flexibilities of the cooperative societies are main reasons for huge financial investment by
          community members which include monthly and weekly cash deposits, higher interest on investment as compared to
          other financial institutions, etc.
